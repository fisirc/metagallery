## What is Stiller

Stiller is both a **single-node** content distribution "network" and
multi-purposed server created as part of the MetaGallery project. It is built as
a totally self-contained, sqlite-based web service deployed through air and
actions.

## Components

Stiller is built almost totally upon the stdlib http serving packages except for
the router (where
[julienschmidt/httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter) shines).
